# Genesis

Genesis is a Django-based web application for reading, rating, and interacting with web novels. It features a full user system, advanced novel and chapter management, social interactions, and a polished, highly customizable frontend.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

**Distinctiveness**  
- Implements a social web novel platform with a robust rating system, user profiles, bookmarks, and interactive comment threads.
- Integrates user profile customization, including avatars, bookmarks, and biographical data.
- Features rich client-side customization (fonts, colors, reading modes) using the static/novel JavaScript and CSS assets.

**Complexity**  
- The data model connects users, novels, chapters, ratings, tags, genres, and comments with complex relationships, including many-to-many and foreign key dependencies.
- The backend supports RESTful AJAX endpoints (for ratings/comments), authentication decorators, and robust error handling.
- The frontend (static/novel) enables persistent user settings, dynamic content loading, and seamless navigation between reading and stats pages.
- Advanced features such as chapter navigation with process saving, real-time statistics, and content export.

## File Overview

### Backend (Python/Django)
- **novel/models.py**  
  - Defines the main data entities: `User`, `Novel`, `Chapter`, `Rating`, `Comment`, etc.
  - Users have avatars, bookmarks, profile info, and can create novels.
  - Novels are linked to users (authors), can have tags, genres, ratings, and track statistics (views, comments, bookmarks).
  - Chapters are linked to novels and track views/comments.
  - Ratings and comments are linked to users and novels, supporting detailed feedback and discussion.

- **novel/views.py**  
  - Handles authentication, content browsing, rating submissions, comment deletion, and pagination.
  - Provides endpoints for AJAX actions (e.g., posting ratings) and uses Djangoâ€™s decorators for security.
  - Renders key pages: user profiles, novel lists, chapter content, stats, etc.

### Frontend (static/novel)
Here are descriptions of the files you requested, suitable for inclusion in your README under a "Frontend File Overview" or similar section:

- **comments.js**  
  Handles the display and dynamic updating of comments on novels and chapters.  
  - Sends AJAX requests to fetch, post, or delete comments without page reloads.
  - Updates the DOM to show new comments instantly.
  - Supports threaded replies and may handle client-side validation or error display for comment actions.

- **ratings.js**  
  Manages the user rating system for novels.  
  - Enables users to submit ratings (such as stars or category-specific ratings) via interactive UI elements.
  - Sends rating data to the backend via AJAX and updates displayed averages and counts in real time.
  - Prevents duplicate ratings and gives feedback to users on successful or failed submissions.

- **tabs.js**  
  Controls the navigation and display of tabbed content within the novel reading interface.  
  - Allows switching between different sections such as "Details", "Comments", "Ratings", or "Chapters" without full-page reloads.
  - Listens for tab clicks and updates the visible content accordingly, improving user experience by making navigation seamless.

- **Novel <-> Tag/Genre**: Novels can have multiple tags and genres (many-to-many).
- **Novel/Chapter <-> Views/Stats**: Views and ratings are aggregated per novel and per chapter.
